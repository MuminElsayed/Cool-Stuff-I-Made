# Cool-Stuff-I-Made
This is a collection of interesting scripts I made during my game dev career, used as references or quick see through of my work.

I sorted them into different folders according to their usage (managers, game systems, misc).

Any feedback is appreciated at: muminelsayed@gmail.com
